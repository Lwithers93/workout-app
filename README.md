# workout-app
Created a simple web application workout planner using JavaScript, HTML + CSS

This was one of my first projects frontend code to publish a live web application. 

The aim of this app is to provide the user with an easy-to-follow workout plan, based on their choice of workout type. This application models many Coaching or Training site products.
